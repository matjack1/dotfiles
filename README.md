# matjack1's dotfiles

## Organization

In the beginning a setup.sh script will be launched for every topic that
has one.

Each topic has its own symlink files and folders that will be linked to
dotfiles and dotfolders in the home folder.

Each topic can have .zsh files that will be added to custom ZSH
functions in oh-my-zsh custom folder.

## Inspirations

[Zach Holman](https://raw.github.com/holman) 
[dotfiles](https://github.com/holman/dotfiles) 
for topical organization and for ideas on zsh and symlinking mechanism.

[Mathias Bynens](https://github.com/mathiasbynens) for his 
[OSX setup](https://github.com/mathiasbynens/dotfiles/blob/master/.osx)
